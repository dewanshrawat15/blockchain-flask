# Blockchain Flask

An attempt to create a basic blockchain network. The idea behind was making this to try to understand Blockchain on a more fundamental level.

## Usage
- Fire up your ```terminal / cmd```
- Navigate to the location of your liking and then ```git clone https://github.com/dewanshrawat15/blockchain-flask```
- Open the ```blockchain-flask``` folder by ```cd blockchain-flask```
- Run
  - ```python -m venv myvenv```
- ### To activate the environment
  - #### On Windows
    - Run ```myvenv\Scripts\activate```
  - #### On MacOS / Linux
    - Run ```source myvenv/bin/activate```
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run ```python server.py```
- Fire up POSTMAN or use CURL to make requests according to call (mine / transactions / chain / nodes)

## Future Plans
I plan to make a GUI available for the users.
